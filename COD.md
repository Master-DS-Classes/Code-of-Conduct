# Code-of-Conduct

Master Cohorts is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all Master Cohorts spaces, including meetups, Twitter, Slack, mailing lists, both online and offline. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Founding Members.

Some Master Cohorts spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

 

## The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they're not appropriate.
* Threats of violence in any of the spaces ("doxing").
* Personal insults of any kind.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
* Harassing or inappropriate photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events, and behavior that interferes with another's full participation will not be tolerated.
* Heckling the speaker.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
